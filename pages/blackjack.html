            Growing up cards where a big part of how I spent my free time. My family is a big cards family, so everything from war, go fish, uno, to 
            screw your neighbor and cribbage where played at almost every family event and then some. I wanted to replicate this into a command line
            game for one of the games that is popular amongst a majority of the people who play/know card games, blackjack. 
            <br>
            My implementation was going to be simple. I was going to start with simple logic first before worrying about outcomes and payouts since 
            that will lay the groundwork for the rest of the game. I started just with a dealt card, since cards are dealt in every hand but with a 
            different number of cards per hand based on play I needed something simple that could be universal if one card needed to be dealt. I went
            with the approach of assuming there are multiple decks being played that way it keeps it even more simple instead of wasting time and space
            checking and keeping track of already dealt cards, which would be more in line with a poker game rather than blackjack. 
            <br>
            Next was dealing two hands, the dealer and player. Each playing person at the "table" is dealt two cards, with the same casino convention
            of the dealer having one face down card, but we still check if the dealer is dealt blackjack off deal before any action takes place. I 
            kept track of the face down card by having a simple boolean variable that is set to false and only after the player plays their hand is that
            boolean value set to true, revealing the actual value and suit and total score of the dealers hand.
            <br> 
            As of right now it is very rudamentary with just the classic play style being played, there is no options to double down or split which can
            be added to the game logic later but as of right now it is traditional play. The score is just kept track in a text file, with simple read and 
            write logic to obtain the balance and read/write it to the text file.
